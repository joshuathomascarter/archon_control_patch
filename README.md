# Entropy Verilog Bridge Project

This repository provides a set of tools and Verilog code for generating and integrating an "entropy bus" into a pipelined CPU design, primarily aimed at hardware simulation (e.g., using Verilog simulators). The project enhances the CPU's hazard mitigation system by allowing external, potentially unpredictable, data (entropy) to dynamically influence control logic such as pipeline stalls and flushes.

## Project Components

1.  **`generate_entropy_bus.py`**: A Python script designed to generate a stream of **16-bit** entropy values.
2.  **`entropy_bus.txt`**: The binary output file produced by the Python script, containing the generated entropy data. This file serves as the "entropy bus" input for the Verilog simulation.
3.  **`control_unit.rs`**: This file, contains **Verilog** code for a CPU's control unit and associated modules. It is updated to read the external entropy conceptually and integrate it into the hazard control logic.

## Why This Matters

Incorporating external entropy or unpredictable data into hardware control systems offers significant advantages, especially in complex designs related to security, adaptive performance, and robust system behavior.

**Key Applications/Benefits:**

* **Adaptive Performance**: Dynamically adjusting pipeline behavior (stalls/flushes) based on real-time entropy levels. This allows the pipeline to react to unpredictable system conditions or external factors.
* **Chaos Engineering/Testing**: Injecting controlled "noise" or random values into the system to test its resilience and stability under non-ideal, chaotic conditions.
* **Intelligent Hazard Mitigation**: Creating a multi-faceted control system where simple entropy thresholds are combined with advanced predictions from Machine Learning (ML) models and chaos detectors, leading to more sophisticated and resilient hazard mitigation.
* **Security**: While simple entropy for pipeline control isn't direct cryptographic randomness, it lays groundwork for incorporating true random number generators (TRNGs) for security-critical applications within hardware.

## `generate_entropy_bus.py`

This Python script generates a sequence of **16-bit** entropy values and saves them to a binary file.

### Usage:

```bash
python generate_entropy_bus.py --output entropy_bus.txt --samples 1000 --noisy
